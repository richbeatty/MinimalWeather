This is really only useful on the MP01. 

It is also literally just an html file wrapped in the standard Android Studio WebView.

It defaults to your current location(you can search for any othe rlocation). You can refresh it by tapping the GPS button again. It defaults to Fahrenheit(although that can be easily changed in the html) but can be toggled with the top right button.
